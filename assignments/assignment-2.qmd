# Assignment 2 (Web Scraping of Turkish Movies form IMDb)

For the start of my work i follow the instructions on the assignment to achieve necessary page and its url.

I also wathched tutorials for this project on youtube. I started with the loading necessary libraries . I also used google extension named selector gadget.

I started with the first url that containts more recent movies (2010-2023).


```{r}
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

# our first url 
url1 = "https://m.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&release_date=2010-01-01,2023-12-31&num_votes=2500,&country_of_origin=TR&count=250"
# scraping the movie titles
title1 <- read_html(url1) %>%
  html_elements(".ipc-title__text") %>%
  html_text()
title1 <- tail(head(title1,-1),-1)
title1 <- str_split(title1, " ", n=2)
title1 <- unlist(lapply(title1, function(x) {x[2]}))
print(title1)

year1 <- read_html(url1) %>%
  html_elements(".dli-title-metadata-item:nth-child(1)") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  as.numeric()

duration1 <- read_html(url1) %>%
  html_elements(".dli-title-metadata-item:nth-child(2)") %>%
  html_text()
duration1 <- unlist(lapply(duration1, convert_time))
print(duration1)

# scraping rating 
rating1 <- read_html(url1) %>%
  html_elements(".ratingGroup--imdb-rating") %>%
  html_text()

# I struggled something here so i searched and find a solution. This code somehow is making sure that there are no NAs to stopping us even if there are any. (If the code is working, do not touch, right? :)) 
rating1 <- as.numeric(str_extract(rating1, "\\d+\\.\\d+"))




# scraping votes 
votes1 <- read_html(url1) %>%
  html_elements(".kRnqtn") %>%
  html_text()

#  scrapped  text and converting it to numeric
votes1 <- as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9]", "", votes1))


# Checking the length of all vectors
if (length(title1) == length(year1) &&
    length(title1) == length(duration1) &&
    length(title1) == length(rating1) &&
    length(title1) == length(votes1)) {
  
  # Finally we are creating our data frame to see if it works
  movie_list <- data.frame(
    title = title1,
    year = year1,
    duration = duration1,
    rating = rating1,
    votes = votes1
  )
  
  # Here is the list of all movies between 2010-2023
  print(movie_list)
} else {
  # if vector lengths did not become same
  print("Error: Vectors have different lengths.")
}
```
