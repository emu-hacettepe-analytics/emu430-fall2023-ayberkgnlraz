It contains the basic features and applications of R. It also give information about the jobs that are using R and their average salaries.\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the difference between th R programming language and the Python programming language is that in R, when you want to acces the elements in a sequence, you need to start counting from one, but for Python, you need to start counting from zero. That is, for R the first element is at position one, but for Python the first element is at position zero.\nFor example Let’s say we have a vector in R and we named it my_vector. What we need to do to select the first element in this vector :\n\nmy_vector[1]\n\nTo select the first element from an existing list in Python, we do this:\n\nmy_list[0]"
